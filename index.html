            <p class="indent">
                Tiara Joy was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. She grew up in the 17th ward, Uptown Hollygrove area. Her parents' musical talents inspired her to get into music at a young age. Tiara was only 11 when she started playing the piano, tenor/alto saxophone, and clarinet. She participated in the Lafayette Academy Charter School marching band during middle school. While attending Lafayette, she had the opportunity to play with the Preservation Hall All-Star band alongside her jazz teacher, Louis Ford.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                Tiara Joy auditioned and got accepted into the Media Arts program at NOCCA (The New Orleans Center for Creative Arts) for high school. While there, Tiara has collaborated with many art departments; jazz, classical, visual, creative writing, and vocal. She wrote/produced, and performed songs that are a part of NOCCA's first 2019 Vinyl Record. During her Sophomore year, Tiara composed a horn section for the New Orleans Saints 'Shut 'Em Down' anthem. The song was featured the same year during the Saints thanksgiving Bose commercial.</p> 
            <p class="indent">
                Tiara Joy's long line of music experiences helped develop her drive to learn more about the music industry as a musician/producer. In 2021, Tiara received a full scholarship to attend Loyola of New Orleans to major in Music Industry Studies. During her education at Loyola, she plans to work toward building an empire filled with artists who embody a love for music. It has always been a dream for Tiara to become an entrepreneur and help educate others within her field. On October 21, 2020, after her 18th birthday, Tiara registered her business: Misty Entertainment LLC, in Louisiana.</p>
